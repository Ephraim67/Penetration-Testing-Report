To carry out **Basic Full-Scope Penetration Testing** and **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Simulation**, you will need **specific access and resources** from the organization. Below is a breakdown of what you need and how you can start.  

---

## **1. Access & Permissions Needed from the Organization**
### **1.1 General Requirements**
âœ… **Signed NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)** â€“ To ensure confidentiality and avoid legal issues.  
âœ… **Written Authorization** â€“ A formal approval letter or email from the organization stating you are authorized to test.  
âœ… **Point of Contact (POC)** â€“ Someone from IT/security to communicate with for coordination.  

### **1.2 Network & Infrastructure Access**
âœ… **VPN Access Credentials** â€“ If staff log in via VPN, you need **test user credentials** to simulate access.  
âœ… **Internal Network Access** â€“ IP whitelisting to allow your testing tools to communicate.  
âœ… **Firewall Rules (if required)** â€“ To allow penetration testing traffic (limited to your IPs).  

### **1.3 System & Server Access**
âœ… **Non-Privileged and Admin Accounts** â€“ To test for **privilege escalation** vulnerabilities.  
âœ… **Database Access (Read-Only or Test Environment)** â€“ To assess MySQL, Oracle, and Cassandra security.  
âœ… **Web Application & API Credentials** â€“ If authentication is required, request test accounts.  

### **1.4 Source Code & Application Details**
âœ… **Access to Source Code (if available)** â€“ For **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**.  
âœ… **API Documentation & Endpoints** â€“ To conduct **API penetration testing** properly.  
âœ… **Application Hosting Details** â€“ Is the fintech app deployed via **Docker, Kubernetes, or standalone servers**?

## **2. How to Start the Security Assessment**
### **Step 1: Pre-Engagement Phase**
ðŸ”¹ Sign **NDA & Obtain Written Authorization**  
ðŸ”¹ Define **Scope, Objectives, and Constraints** with the organization  
ðŸ”¹ Request **test accounts, VPN access, and network permissions**  
ðŸ”¹ Schedule **testing timeframes** to minimize business disruption  

### **Step 2: Reconnaissance & Information Gathering**
ðŸ”¹ Use **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)** to gather public information  
ðŸ”¹ Scan **subdomains, IPs, and network assets**  
ðŸ”¹ Check **dark web for leaked credentials**  

### **Step 3: Vulnerability Scanning & Exploitation**
ðŸ”¹ Perform **automated scanning** (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS)  
ðŸ”¹ Conduct **manual testing** for web, database, and network vulnerabilities  
ðŸ”¹ Exploit **weak authentication, SQLi, RCE, privilege escalation**  

### **Step 4: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Simulation**
ðŸ”¹ Establish **initial foothold via phishing, VPN access, or web exploitation**  
ðŸ”¹ Set up **C2 (Command & Control) infrastructure**  
ðŸ”¹ Conduct **lateral movement and privilege escalation**  
ðŸ”¹ Exfiltrate **simulated sensitive data**  

### **Step 5: Reporting & Remediation**
ðŸ”¹ Document **all vulnerabilities, exploits, and their impact**  
ðŸ”¹ Provide **recommendations and mitigation strategies**  
ðŸ”¹ Conduct **re-testing to validate fixes**

## **3. Additional Considerations**
âœ” **What if thereâ€™s no access to source code?**  
Use **black-box testing** techniques like fuzzing, reverse engineering, and runtime analysis.  

âœ” **What if the organization is hesitant about testing?**  
Start with a **non-intrusive security assessment**, such as **passive recon and vulnerability scanning**.  

âœ” **How can I bypass VPN restrictions?**  
Request a **test account** with the same privileges as a regular employee or a **jump host**.
