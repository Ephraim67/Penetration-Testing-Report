Based on the provided HTTP request and login header, here are the security tests you can start with:

### **1. Session Management Testing**
- **Session Hijacking:** Check if the `JSESSIONID` is predictable or can be reused in another session.
- **Session Fixation:** Try logging in with a predefined session ID and see if it's accepted after authentication.
- **Session Timeout:** Test if the session expires after a reasonable period of inactivity.
- **Session Cookies:** Analyze the cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`) to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.

### **2. Authentication Testing**
- **Credential Leakage:** Since the request includes `username` and `password` in cookies, check if they are stored insecurely or sent over HTTP.
- **Brute Force Attack:** Try sending multiple requests with different credentials to check if there are rate-limiting or account lockout mechanisms.
- **Weak Password Policy:** Test if the system allows weak passwords (e.g., `123456`, `password`).

### **3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Reflected XSS:** Inject payloads in the `Referer` header or other request parameters.
- **Stored XSS:** Check if inputs are stored and executed in a different part of the application.

### **4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **CSRF Token Absence:** See if the website lacks CSRF protection by checking if login requests work from a third-party site.
- **CSRF Token Reuse:** If a token is present, check if it remains valid across multiple sessions.

### **5. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
- **User Enumeration:** Modify the `username=username;` cookie value to another user and see if it grants access.
- **Banking Features Testing:** If this web app is a banking system, try accessing unauthorized endpoints.

### **6. CORS Misconfiguration**
- **Check for Open CORS:** If CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) allow `*` or untrusted domains, it may lead to unauthorized access.
- **CORS with Credentials:** If `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` is set with a wildcard origin, itâ€™s a security risk.

### **7. Transport Layer Security (TLS) Testing**
- **Insecure HTTP:** The `Referer` indicates that the site allows HTTP, meaning credentials might be exposed.
- **SSL/TLS Misconfigurations:** Check for weak ciphers and protocols using tools like `testssl.sh`.

### **Steps to Carryout**
1. Intercept the request with **Burp Suite** to manipulate session cookies, headers, and parameters.
2. Check **response headers** for security misconfigurations (`X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, etc.).
3. Perform **fuzzing** with invalid inputs to uncover hidden vulnerabilities.
