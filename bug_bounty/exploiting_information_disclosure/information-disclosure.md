## Introduction to Information Disclosure Vulnerability


**Information Disclosure** (also known as **Information Leakage**) is a vulnerability that occurs when an application **unintentionally exposes sensitive data** to users or attackers. This can include technical details, system configuration, internal files, or even personally identifiable information (PII).



### What is Information Disclosure?

It's when **confidential information is exposed** through a system due to:

* Poor configuration
* Insecure error messages
* Verbose debug logs
* Misbehaving components or APIs


### Why It Matters

Information disclosure can assist attackers by giving them:

* Internal IP addresses, software versions, or usernames
* Stack traces or source code
* Configuration files and environment variables
* Passwords or tokens
* Database schema or error details

This **low-hanging fruit** can **greatly enhance the success of future attacks**, like:

* Exploiting known vulnerabilities (with version info)
* Brute-force or credential stuffing (with usernames/emails)
* Crafting exploits or identifying entry points


### Common Sources of Information Disclosure

| Source                    | Example                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Error Messages**        | Full stack trace showing file paths and server details |
| **Headers**               | `Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)` reveals software info |
| **Debug Features**        | Verbose output or debug tools left enabled             |
| **Backup Files**          | `.bak`, `.zip`, or `~` files exposed on the server     |
| **Directory Listing**     | Unintended access to folders and file structures       |
| **Git or .env files**     | `.git/config`, `.env` leaked in web root               |
| **Verbose API Responses** | Detailed JSON or XML messages with internal fields     |



### Real-World Examples

1. **Facebook Bug Bounty:** Leaking internal server IPs in HTTP headers
2. **Stack Overflow:** Exposed debug information revealing stack traces and API keys
3. **Tesla (2018):** Open Kubernetes dashboard exposing credentials and logs



### Mitigation Techniques

* Disable verbose error messages in production
* Sanitize logs and user output
* Restrict access to sensitive files and endpoints
* Use proper permissions and directory access control
* Strip unnecessary headers (`Server`, `X-Powered-By`)
* Set correct CORS and Content Security Policies
* Regularly scan your application using tools like:

  * Burp Suite
  * OWASP ZAP
  * Nikto
  * Nmap (for service banners)



### Best Practice

* Follow the **principle of least privilege**
* Treat **internal data as public unless protected**
* Conduct **regular security reviews** and penetration testing
