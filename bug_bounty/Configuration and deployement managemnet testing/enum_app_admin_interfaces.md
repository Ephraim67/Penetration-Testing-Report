 **Guideline for penetration testers** or **security auditors** on how to find and test **administrator interfaces** in web applications, which are often **entry points for privilege escalation or unauthorized access**.


###  **What are Administrator Interfaces?**

Administrator interfaces are special parts of a website or application that allow **privileged users (like admins)** to:

* Create/manage user accounts
* Change the site’s appearance or settings
* Modify or access sensitive data
* Configure the application/server

They are powerful—and if **not properly protected**, attackers can misuse them.



### **Goal of Testing**

To find out:

* If hidden admin panels or controls exist
* Whether normal users or attackers can **find and access** them
* If it's possible to **bypass security** (e.g., login or privilege checks)



### **How to Test**

####  Black-Box Testing (No internal knowledge of the app)

Techniques used by attackers or external testers:

1. **URL Guessing (Directory/Path Enumeration):**
   Try URLs like:

   ```
   /admin
   /administrator
   /admin/login
   ```

   or use **automated tools** to guess folders/files.

2. **Google Dorks:**
   Use search engines to discover exposed admin pages by crafting specific queries.

3. **Source Code Inspection:**
   View the HTML source of public pages. Look for:

   * Comments or links revealing admin paths
   * Hidden input fields like `<input type="hidden" name="admin" value="no">`
   * Cookies with admin-related data

4. **Documentation/Defaults:**
   Some applications use default settings. If admins didn’t change them, you might access the admin panel using **default credentials**.

5. **Alternative Ports:**
   Admin pages might be on different ports (e.g., `8080`, `8443`, etc.).

6. **Parameter Tampering:**
   Change POST/GET values or cookies to trick the app into thinking you're an admin.
   Example:

   ```http
   Cookie: sessionid=xyz; useradmin=1
   ```

7. **Brute Forcing Login:**
   If you find an admin login page, try username/password guessing using tools like:

   * **THC-HYDRA**
   * **OWASP ZAP (Forced Browse)**

    *Be cautious of account lockouts.*



####  Gray-Box Testing (With some internal knowledge)

More advanced and deeper testing, including:

* Check server settings and code for **default admin access** or hardcoded credentials
* Ensure **access control is in place** (IP whitelisting, multi-factor authentication, etc.)
* Review shared code between user and admin interfaces to ensure **no leakage of admin functions/data**
* Analyze web framework behavior (e.g., WordPress’s `wp-admin`, WebLogic’s `/AdminMain`)



###  Example Admin Paths (Based on Platform)

Each framework/CMS has known paths. For example:

**WordPress:**

* `/wp-admin/`
* `/wp-admin/admin-functions.php`

**PHP Apps:**

* `/phpmyadmin/`
* `/mysqladmin/`

**WebLogic:**

* `/AdminMain`
* `/AdminEvents`

And many more listed in the document.



### Recommended Tools

* **OWASP ZAP:** For directory brute-force (replacement for DirBuster).
* **THC-HYDRA:** For brute-forcing logins.
* **Good Wordlists:** Like the one from Netsparker, to make brute-forcing effective.



This guide helps testers:

* **Find hidden admin interfaces**
* **Attempt unauthorized access**
* **Evaluate if the application properly separates admin and normal users**

**Goal:** Ensure that only authorized admins can reach and use admin functionality, and detect any potential weaknesses attackers might exploit.
